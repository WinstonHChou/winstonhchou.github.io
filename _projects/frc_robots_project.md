## Overview
Joining the founding team of C.K. Robotics as part of FRC#8020 CyberpunK was not just a project— it was the spark that ignited my passion for robotics and engineering. From the beginning, we faced enormous challenges: limited resources, tight deadlines, and the steep learning curves that come with building competition-grade robots from scratch. As Team Captain and Technical Lead, I didn't just oversee tasks—I built a community of driven individuals, fostering a culture of creativity and resilience under pressure.

Every late night spent troubleshooting wiring, tuning control algorithms, or iterating mechanical designs taught me more than technical skills. It taught me leadership—how to inspire a team, how to embrace failure as a step toward success, and how innovation thrives in collaboration. Winning the Rookie Game Changer Award was a proud milestone, but more impactful was the collective journey of transforming ideas into working robots that competed on a global stage.

Stepping beyond my own growth, I embraced the role of mentor to guide the next generation, sharing insights from advanced control theories to practical design verification. It is deeply rewarding to see young engineers discover their own spark and push boundaries in their projects, knowing I played a part in their journey.

This experience shapes not only my technical toolkit but fuels my drive to solve complex problems, lead innovative teams, and contribute meaningfully to the future of robotics and engineering.
