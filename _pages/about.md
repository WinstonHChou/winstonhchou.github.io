Hi, I'm Winstonâ€”a robotics enthusiast and an aspiring applied scientist currently studying at UC San Diego. I dive into engineering, physics, and management studies to push the boundaries of robotics, artificial intelligence, and applied sciences. 

I also work as a teaching assistant for ECE/MAE 148: Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles, alongside Professor [Jack Silberman](linkedin.com/in/jacksilberman). Outside of research and teaching, I'm passionate about promoting STEM education through outreach programs that inspire future innovators.
