Hi, I'm Winston—a robotics undergraduate researcher at UC San Diego working on learning-enabled autonomy for robots operating in complex, uncertain environments. I dive into engineering, physics, and management studies to push the boundaries of robotics, artificial intelligence, and applied sciences. 

I'm advised by Prof. [Nikolay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io/) in the Existential Robotics Laboratory, where I work on quadrotor mapping and autonomous navigation. I’ve also served as a teaching assistant for ECE/MAE 148: Introduction to Autonomous Vehicles with Dr. [Jack Silberman](https://linkedin.com/in/jacksilberman). Outside of research and teaching, I'm passionate about promoting STEM education through outreach programs that inspire future innovators.
